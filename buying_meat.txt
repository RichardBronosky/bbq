1. Assume that 1/4lb is a serving and women/children will eat 1 and men will eat 2. (Add an extra man or child below to account for people you know to be big eaters.)
2. Bone-in pork sholder/butt has about a 60% yield. Therefore, 1lb yields 2.4 servings
3. Estimate raw meat to buy as: Buy = (2*Men+1*Women)/2.4 Therefore for 15 men and 10 women/children: (2*15+1*10)/2.4 = Buy 16.66 lbs
