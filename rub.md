# BBQ Rub

I suggest leaving the salt and brown sugar out when making a large batch. Keep the extra in this for and it's much more versitile for adding to foods. Mix in the salt and sugar only when needed. This also gives you a much smaller volume to store.

## To make 2 cups
* Salt & Sugar 48 parts
  * 1/2 cup or 24 parts
    * kosher salt (*not* table salt)
    * dark brown sugar (optional)
      * I've done this for a group of 30 doctors and was amazed at how good it was even without the sugar.
* Spices 49 parts
  * 3 tbsp or 9 parts
    * ground black pepper
  * 2 tbsp or 6 parts
    * dry mustard
    * garlic powder
    * onion powder
    * paprika
    * chili powder
  * 1 tbsp or 3 parts
    * ground ginger
    * rubbed thyme
    * cumin
  * 1 tsp or 1 parts
    * nutmeg
